	<div id="content">The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet
		protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link billions of devices worldwide. It is a network of networks that consists of
		millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a
		broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive
		range of information resources and services, such as mobile apps including social media apps, the inter-linked
		hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, multiplayer online games,
		telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.<br><br>The origins of the Internet date back to research
		commissioned by the United States government in the 1960s to build robust, fault-tolerant communication via
		computer networks. The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for
		interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1980s. The funding of a new U.S. backbone by
		the National Science Foundation in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial backbones, led to
		worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks.[3]
		The linking of commercial enterprises by the early 1990s marks the beginning of the transition to the modern
		Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile
		computers were connected to the network.<br><br>Although the Internet has been widely used by academia since the
		1980s, the commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern
		human life. As of 2014, 38 percent of the world's human population has used the services of the Internet within
		the past year-over 100 times more people than were using it in 1995. Internet use grew rapidly in the West from
		the mid-1990s to early 2000s and from the late 1990s to present in the developing world.<br><br>Most traditional
		communications media, including telephony and television, are being reshaped or redefined by the Internet,
		giving birth to new services such as Internet telephony and Internet television. Newspaper, book, and other
		print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging and web feeds. The
		entertainment industry, including music, film, and gaming, was initially the fastest growing online segment. The
		Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of human interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums,
		and social networking. Online shopping has grown exponentially both for major retailers and small artisans and
		traders. Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire
		industries.</div>
